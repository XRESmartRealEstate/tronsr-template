We are Smart Real Estate. 
Smart Real Estate will prove to the world that the current real estate market and practices are old and out dated. 
The perfect example is when you write a letter with a pen and paper and mail it off to someone. This is how the current Deed Registry system is.

Our goal is not only to be the biggest Real estate company in the world, but to be the biggest crypto real estate company in the world.
